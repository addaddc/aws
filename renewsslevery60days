By default, Let's Encrypt certificates are issued with a validity period of 90 days. 
To renew the certificate automatically every 60 days, you can use a cron job to run the certbot renew command periodically.
Here's an example cron job that will run the certbot renew command every day at 3:00am:
Open the crontab file for the root user:

sudo crontab -e

Add the following line to the file:


0 3 * * * /usr/bin/certbot renew --quiet --deploy-hook "systemctl reload nginx"


This command will run the certbot renew command every day at 3:00am, and will reload tomcat after the certificate is renewed.

Save and exit the file.

This cron job will run the certbot renew command every day, but the certificate will only be renewed if it is within 60 days of expiration. If the certificate is not due for renewal, the command will exit silently without doing anything.

Note that the --deploy-hook option is used to reload Nginx after the certificate is renewed. You can adjust this option to reload Apache or another web server instead, or to perform other actions after the certificate is renewed.
